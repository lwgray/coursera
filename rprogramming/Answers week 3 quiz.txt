# correct -> How can one calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) by number of cylinders in the car (cyl)? -> See Answer #1 
# Wrong. Iris Sepal.Length Mean -> 7 -> See Answer # 2
# correct -> means of variables of Sepal-Length, Sepal-Width, Pedal-Length, Pedal-Width -> See Answer #3
# Correct -> What happens after you enter this command debug(ls) -> Answer #4
# wrong -> what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars? -> 12
#
# Answer 1
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean))
with(mtcars, tapply(mpg,cyl, mean))
#
# Answer 2
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
#
# Answer 3
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
#
# Answer 4
Immediately stops function and brings up browser
#
# Answer 5
a <- tapply(mtcars$hp, mtcars$cyl, mean)
a[1] - a[3] -> 126.5779 -> 127
